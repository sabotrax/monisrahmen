## Assembly instructions

### Overview

These instructions are for the redesigned frame.

### BOM:

* Printed parts.
* 4 x M3*18 screw and nut.
* 4 x M25*12 screw and nut.
* 3 x Jumper wire female-to-female 20 cm.
* 1 x HDMI cable mini HDMI male to HDMI male 30 cm.
* 1 x USB cable micro male to micro male.
* 1 x Display Waveshare 7inch QLED 1024Ã—600 (Touch is not used atm, so this is a waste of money. Go for the non-touch version if available.)
* 1 x Raspberry Pi Zero 2.
* 1 x Sensor HLK-LD2410C Human Presence Motion Module.

### Step 1

* Use pictures/frame2_board.jpg as a reference.
* Mount the Pi Zero to the lower bracket using 4 x M25 screws fitting the spacers between Pi and bracket.

### Step 2

* Insert 4 x M3 screws into the base from underneath.
* Mount the display onto the base via the screws with the HDMI port facing down and away from the sensor mount.

### Step 3

* Mount the lower and upper brackets onto the base and fix them with 4 x M3 nuts.

### Step 4

* Connect 3 jumper wires to the pins of the sensor VCC, GND and OUT.
* Connect the wires to the Pi VCC to Pin 2 (5V), GND to Pin 6 (GND) and OUT to Pin 11 (GPIO17).
* Secure the sensor to the base with a drop of super glue (optional).

### Step 5

* Use frame2_back.jpg as a reference. 
* Glue the mount of the stand to the case so that it sits above the opening in the back.

### Step 6

* Clip the case onto the snap fits of the base with the groves in the case facing up.
* Connect the display to the Pi using the USB and HDMI cables fitting the cables through the culvert of the case.

### Step 7

* Put the base on the passepartout and fix it with the retaining pins. You might have to sand down the pins somewhat.
* Fit the stand into the mount on the back of the case. You might have to sand down the insert part of the stand somewhat.
